# Visualization and EDA of PIMA Indian Diabetes Dataset


Overview
This project focuses on the Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and visualization of the PIMA Indian Diabetes dataset. The aim is to gain insights into the dataset's features and their relationships to better understand factors contributing to diabetes among PIMA Indian women.

Dataset
The PIMA Indian Diabetes dataset consists of various health-related variables such as glucose level, blood pressure, insulin, BMI, age, and diabetes status. It is sourced from a study conducted on PIMA Indian women near Phoenix, Arizona.

Purpose
The purpose of this project is to:

Explore the distribution of different features in the dataset.
Identify correlations between variables.
Visualize patterns and trends within the data.
Gain insights that could aid in understanding the risk factors associated with diabetes among PIMA Indian women.
Tools and Libraries Used
Python
Google Colab
Pandas
NumPy
Matplotlib
Seaborn
Files
PIMA_Indian_Diabetes_Data.ipynb: Google Colab Notebook containing the Python code for data analysis, visualization, and interpretation.
diabetes.csv: The dataset used in the analysis.
Usage
Open the Google Colab Notebook PIMA_Indian_Diabetes_Data.ipynb in Google Colab.
Ensure you have access to the diabetes.csv file, either by uploading it to Google Colab or by mounting Google Drive if the file is stored there.
Follow the instructions in the Notebook to execute the code cells and visualize the data.
Results
The analysis reveals various insights into the PIMA Indian Diabetes dataset, including:

Distribution of glucose levels among the subjects.
Correlation between BMI and insulin levels.
Impact of age on diabetes occurrence.
Visualization of diabetes occurrences based on different health parameters.
Future Work
Perform predictive modeling to predict diabetes occurrence based on the dataset features.
Explore additional datasets to validate findings and enhance understanding.
Implement machine learning algorithms for deeper analysis and predictive accuracy.
